# Consistent Hashing in Java

This repository contains an implementation of consistent hashing in Java. Consistent hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to evenly distribute data across multiple nodes while minimizing the impact of adding or removing nodes from the system.

## Features

- **Consistent Hashing Algorithm**: Implements the consistent hashing algorithm for distributing keys to nodes in a distributed system.
- **Virtual Nodes (optional)**: Supports the use of virtual nodes to improve load balancing and minimize data movement during node additions or removals.
- **Hash Function Flexibility**: Allows customization of the hash function used for mapping keys to hash values.
- **Node Failure Tolerance**: Handles node failures gracefully by redistributing keys to neighboring nodes.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with scalability in mind to handle large datasets and dynamic node configurations.

## Technologies Used

- Java: Programming language for implementation.
## Getting Started

To explore and use the Consistent Hashing implementation in Java, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/consistent-hashing-java.git
cd consistent-hashing-java
